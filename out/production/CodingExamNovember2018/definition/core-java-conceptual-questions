=> Define the same method multiple times so that we can call them with
   different argument lists
   It happen run time.




Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
=>  Unwanted or unexpected event, which occurs during the execution of a program. Like run time
    that disrupts the normal flow of the programâ€™s instructions

        try
            {
          .....
            }

        catch(NumberFormatException ex)

        }

What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
=> Non-access modifier.

   static variable: Single copy of variable is created and shared among all objects at class level.
                    All instances of the class share the same static variable.
                    static variables can create at class-level only

    static method: Can only directly call other static methods
                   Can only directly access static data.

What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
=> fianl variable: value is constant.
   final method: cannot be overridden by subclasses.

What is final, finally and finalize?
=> final : is a keyword used to restricted
           final class can't be inherited,
           final method can't be overridden and
           final variable value can't be changed.

   finally : is a block is use to place of importance
             it will be executed whether exception is handled or not.

   finalize :is a method.
             Used to perform clean up processing just before object is garbage collected

What is a constructor
=> Block of code similar to a method that's called when an instance of an object
   is created.
   It should be same name of class.

Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
=> Yes, We can do by changing the signature

If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?
=>

What is "this" keyword in java ?
=> "this" keyword works as a reference to the current Object,
    whose Method or constructor is being invoked

What is "super" keyword in java? How many possible way can you use?

What is the difference between JDK and JVM?

What is the difference between JVM and JRE?

What is compile time and run time?
=> The source code must be compiled into machine code in order to become and executable program.
   This compilation process is referred to as compile time.

What is heap?

How java manage it's memory?

   "super" keyword use in other class

The difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector?
    Serial: single-threaded environments
    Parallel: JVM default collector

What is JIT stands for?
=> Just in Time

Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?
=> Heap Space:

   Garbage Collection:  automatically reclaims the memory for reuse and helps
   in eliminating memory leaks and other memory-related problems.
   When an object is no longer used, the Java garbage collector reclaims the underlying memory
   and reuses it for future object allocations.JVM manages the heap area for all objects and as long as the object is being referenced,
   it is considered alive. Once an object is no longer referenced or not reachable by an application,
   the garbage collector removes this object and reclaims the unused memory.

Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?
=>

What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
=>

What is reflection in java and why is it useful?
what is multithreading in java?
=> Allows concurrent execution of two or more parts of a program for maximum utilization of CPU.
   Each part of such program is called a thread.

What is the use of synchronization in Java?
=> It means that two threads cannot execute the method at the same time
    and the JVM takes care of enforcing that.
