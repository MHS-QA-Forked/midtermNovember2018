Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
=> Data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them,
  and the functions or operations that canbe applied to the data.

What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
=> Insert, Delete, Merge, Update

List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
=>

what is an Array?
=> Array holds constant number of values of the same time.

what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
=> Array is a fixed length data structure.
   ArrayList is a variable length Collection class.

what is LinkedList?
=> Linear data structures where the elements are not stored in contiguous locations
   and every element is a separate object with a data part and address part.

How is an Array different from Linked List?
=> In Array, each element is independent and can be accessed using it's index value.
    Linked list, each node/element points to the next, previous, or maybe both nodes.

what is queue?
=> Designed to have elements inserted at the end. Queue follow FIFO.

what is stack?
=> Stack contains method specific values that are short-lived and references to other objects in the heap that are getting referred from the method.

what is FIFO and LIFO?
=> FIFO stands for First In First Out
   LIFO stands for Last In First Out

what is the order of complexity?
=> The smaller the order of complexity of the program's underlying algorithm,
   the faster it will run and the better it will scale as the input gets larger.


what is the best case to search an element from an array?
=> O(n)

what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
=> O(log n)

what is tree in data structure?
=>  Trees are hierarchical data structures.
    Topmost node is called root of the tree.
    The elements that are directly under an element are called its children.
    The element directly above something is called its parent

what is graph in data structure?
=> Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges.

what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
=> Hashtable is synchronized
   HashMap is not synchronized

What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
=>  RDBMS – Array
    Network data model – Graph
    Hierarchical data model – Trees

How HashMap works in java?
=> Allows one null key and any number of null values.

What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
=> ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown to indicate that
   we are trying to access array element with an illegal index.

What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
=>  Manually
    Array.copyof()
    System.arraycopy()
    Object.clone()

What is difference between an array and a linked list?
=>  Array is a set of similar data objects stored in sequential memory locations
    under a common heading or a variable name.

    Linked list is a data structure which contains a sequence of the elements where
    each element is linked to its next element.

What is DFS and BFS?
=>  DFS stand for depth first search. BFS stand for breath first search
    Both algorithm used for Traversing and searching a node in a graph.
    also  used to find out whether a node is reachable from a given node or not.

What is Recursion?
=>  Recursion is a basic programming technique  use in Java,
    in which a method calls itself to solve some problem.

What are linear and non linear data Structures?
=>  Linear: Data is organized in a linear order in which elements are linked
            one after the other
    Non-liner: Involves multiple levels.


What is Big-(O)-notation?
=> Big-(O)-notation: specifically describes the worst-case scenario.
   Used to describe the execution time required or the space used by an algorithm.

Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?

=>  Selection Sort	Ω(n^2)      θ(n^2)      O(n^2)
    Bubble Sort	    Ω(n)        θ(n^2)      O(n^2)
    Insertion Sort	Ω(n)        θ(n^2)      O(n^2)
    Heap Sort	    Ω(n log(n))	θ(n log(n))	O(n log(n))
    Quick Sort	    Ω(n log(n))	θ(n log(n))	O(n^2)
    Merge Sort	    Ω(n log(n))	θ(n log(n))	O(n log(n))
    Bucket Sort	    Ω(n+k)	    θ(n+k)	    O(n^2)


Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
